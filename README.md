## Widget for COVID-19 cases and incidence numbers ##

Widget to be used in [Scriptable-AppStore](https://t.co/XuruULlFCb?amp=1 "Scriptable-AppStore") for iOS14.

Initial source code had been leveraged in from multiple sources, which are listed at the end of this README.md. I modified this source-code for my personal use. Source code used on my device and is not optimized. Feel free to do so.
 
My personal screenshot from widget can be seen below:
